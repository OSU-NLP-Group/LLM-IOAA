VER_INST = """Please think step by step and rigorously verify each step in the provided solution to an IOAA level exam problem. DO NOT solve the problem, correct the errors, or fill the gaps you find.
Please make sure to perform a step-by-step check of the entire solution and justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.
A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.

Here're some common errors that you may pay extra attention to:
- Calculation Error (e.g., correct expression, wrong arithmetic)
- Dimensional Mismatch (e.g., LHS/RHS units don't match)
- Incorrect Order of Magnitude (e.g., clearly implausible scale)
- Inconsistency with Given Data (e.g., reverse-check fails)
- Incorrect Formula / Inapplicable Formula (e.g., using a formula outside its valid range)
- Justification Gap (e.g., conclusion possibly true but argument incomplete/hand-wavy)

In your response to user, please make sure to include a detailed summary of each error you have found by quoting the relevant text and explaining the issue. Conclude your response with a final verdict on the solution's correctness: "The solution is (correct/incorrect)."
