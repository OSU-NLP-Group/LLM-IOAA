\section*{Theory 11: 'X-ray emission from galaxy clusters'}
Clusters of galaxies are strong X-ray sources. It has been established that the emission mechanism is thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation) from a hot hydrogen and helium plasma inside the cluster. The luminosity $L_{X}$ (in Watts) of each component of the plasma is described by the formula:

$$
L_{X}=6 \times 10^{-41} N_{e} N_{X} T^{\frac{1}{2}} V Z_{X}^{2},
$$

where the symbols represent:\\
$X-$ Hydrogen $(\mathrm{H})$ or Helium (He),\\
$N_{e}-$ number density of electrons $\left[\mathrm{m}^{-3}\right]$,\\
$N_{X}-$ number density of ions $X\left[\mathrm{~m}^{-3}\right]$,\\
$Z_{X}$ - atomic number of ion $X$,\\
$T$ - temperature of the plasma $[\mathrm{K}]$,\\
$V$ - volume occupied by the plasma $\left[\mathrm{m}^{3}\right]$.\\
(a) Determine the total mass (in solar masses) of the plasma which emits the X-rays, assuming that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the plasma is fully ionized with 1 helium ion for every 10 hydrogen ions;
  \item $L_{\text {total }}=1.0 \times 10^{37} \mathrm{~W}$,
  \item $T=80 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~K}$,
  \item the plasma is uniformly distributed in a sphere of radius $R=500 \mathrm{kpc}$,
  \item self-absorption is negligible.\\

The photons of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) interact with plasma in a process known as inverse Compton scattering. The CMB normally has a thermal blackbody spectrum at a temperature of 2.73 K . However, interaction with the plasma leads to distortion of the CMB spectrum (known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect).\\
(b) Estimate the mean free path of CMB photons in the plasma, i.e. the average distance travelled by a photon before interacting with an electron. Express it in Mpc. The effective cross section for photon-electron interactions is $\sigma=6.65 \times 10^{-29} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.\\
(5 points)\\
(c) Estimate the typical energy of CMB photons.\\
(d) The energy of CMB photons can be increased by a factor of up to $(1+\beta) /(1-\beta)$ due to the inverse Compton scattering, where $v=\beta c$ is the velocity of electrons. Estimate the energy of scattered CMB photons.\\
