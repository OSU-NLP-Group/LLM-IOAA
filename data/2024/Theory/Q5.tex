The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is radiation emitted during the early Universe. It is reasonably homogeneous and isotropic, and well described by a black-body radiation spectrum. Its emission spectrum today has a peak at a temperature of approximately $T_{\mathrm{today}} \sim \SI{3}{\K}$, as measured by the COBE satellite FIRAS instrument.

    \part[3] What is the redshift ($z$) {at which} the CMB spectrum has a peak at the infrared wavelength of {$\lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim \SI{0.1}{\milli\m}$}? 

    \part[7] By assuming a spatially flat, matter-dominated Universe, what is the age of the Universe corresponding to the redshift of the previous part?
