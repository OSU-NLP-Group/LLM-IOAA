After surviving a shipwreck and reaching a small island in the southern hemisphere, a sailor had to estimate the island's latitude using the Sun.

However, due to poor eyesight, the sailor couldn't see the night stars very well, so his best option was to rely on the Sun. He had no information about the date, but he realized the days were longer than the nights.

\begin{parts}
    \part[7] The sailor noticed that on his first day on the island, the angle between the positions of sunrise and sunset on the horizon was \ang{120}. With this piece of information, determine the range of possible values for the latitude of the island. Neglect the daily motion of the Sun across the ecliptic.
    
    \part[13] The angle between the positions of sunrise and sunset kept increasing daily. After 40 days, this angle was equal to \ang{163}. Estimate the latitude of the island. You may neglect the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.
